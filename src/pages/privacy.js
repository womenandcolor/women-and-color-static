          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Women and Color has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information and to outline our information gathering and sharing practices. We will not share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>By using womenandcolor.com website (the “Service”), you consent to our collection and use of any personal and other information you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Service.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions or concerns related to this Privacy Policy, please contact us via e-mail at hello@womenandcolor.com.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy is supplemental to our Terms of Use.</p>

          <h2>The Service</h2>
          <p>When you use this Service, you may view information and content that is owned, licensed, or provided by us, our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (together, “Women and Color”). We may also provide information and services owed by third parties and distributed by virtue of a license, grant or some other form of agreement. When used in this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us” and “our” mean Women and Color.</p>

          <h2>Using the Website</h2>
          <p>You can review website content without providing any personal or individually identifiable information. You may also be able to set the security settings on your browser or network connected device to prevent certain tracking and logging features. If you do that, the Service may be less functional for you.</p>
          <p>To actively utilize the Service and participate as a Speaker, you will be required to provide personally identifiable information upon registration. Registration provides you with the ability to use interactive features, enter and view information, receive e-mails from us, sign up for events or participate in special promotions. If you choose to register or if you conduct transactions through the Service, we will collect information about the transactions you engage in and your other activities. We need certain information from you to register you, authenticate you and process your registration information and transactions.</p>
          <h2>Kinds of Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We may collect information that you voluntarily give us, as well as location-based information and site visitorship data as described below.</p>
          <p><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em></p>
          <p>In order to take advantage of certain features, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information about you that would enable us to contact you directly. Personally identifiable information includes your e-mail address, name, gender, or persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with personally identifiable information, as well as other information, that you may provide voluntarily. We collect such personally identifiable information that you give us so that we may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>provide you with information about this Service;</li>
            <li>provide information to our third party marketing partners, subject to this policy;</li>
            <li>notify you about new features and products available through this Service;</li>
            <li>respond to your requests for information;</li>
            <li>process survey results and other data you provide;</li>
            <li>filter the services and information offered to you; and</li>
            <li>open, maintain and administer user accounts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will use the personally identifiable information we collect to provide you with specific information and services that you request, and with additional information and services that may be of interest to you. We may also use the personally identifiable information to analyze and improve your experience using the Service and to customize your experience to match your preferences. By providing personally identifiable information, you fully understand and consent to the collection and processing of such information in Canada. To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. While we strive to protect our users’ personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
          <p>We may also collect non-personal information, such as your IP address and use ‘cookies’. The information obtained from collecting IP addresses and using 'cookies’ is not personal information about you. For more information, please read the section on Site Visitorship Data below.</p>
          <p><em>Location-Based Information</em></p>
          <p>We may collect information relating to your general location based on (1) information you manually provide, (2) the IP address of your network connected device, (3) Global Positioning System (GPS) information sent to us by your GPS-enabled device, and (4) the proximity of your computer, tablet, mobile wireless device, personal digital assistant, personal communication system, or other communications device (your “Personal Communication Device”) to the nearest radio tower or cell site. We may also be able to detect when your Personal Communication Device is activated as well as when and how you are using it. Women and Color may collect data to verify the information you provide manually and to provide you with location-based content and advertising. We may associate Personally Identifiable Information with location-based information provided by you and your Personal Communication Device for our internal use and to improve your experience with the Service.</p>
          <p><em>Site Visitorship Data</em></p>
          <p>Site visitorship data is information about the way a website is used that is not associated with an individual’s identity. We use anonymous data regarding online behavior to better understand how people use our Service. To that end, we may use aggregated, anonymous online traffic behavior along with information from third parties to track usage trends and thereby improve the Service. We may also use this aggregated, anonymous information to develop reports that we may share with third party marketing partners and affiliates. The kind of information we may collect includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the date and time you use the Service;</li>
            <li>your Internet service provider, mobile carrier, or data services provider;</li>
            <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>
            <li>the pages you visit;</li>
            <li>the links you click;</li>
            <li>the features used;</li>
            <li>how and when you interact with the Service;</li>
            <li>the content, images and advertisements you select; and</li>
            <li>how you arrived at the Website and where you go when you leave.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most site visitorship data is collected using data collection tools such as web beacons, cookies, embedded web links and other software (together, “Data Collection Tools”). Data Collection Tools are typically small data files or software that are sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive. Most browsers and display software can be set to inform you when Data Collection Tools are being used or other tracking software is being sent to your computer or Personal Communication Device. They also provide you with the option of refusing such Data Collection Tools. However, refusing to allow the use of Data Collection Tools may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, certain areas or features.</p>
          <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
          <p>We will not sell, trade, or otherwise release any personally identifiable information to third parties, not including wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates under common ownership or control, without your consent except as follows below. You hereby authorize us to use your personally identifiable information as follows:</p>
          <p>(1) By providing us your personally identifiable information you grant Women and Color the right to use such information to provide you content and services, and for the benefit of Women and Color without restrictions; personally identifiable information may be used for research and analysis, content, product and site development, and other proprietary uses.</p>
          <p>(2) Women and Color may share information we collect with our sponsors, and business and third party marketing partners. If we share your information, we will request that such third parties treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and refrain from disclosing or using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than the provision of Service to you or for the benefit of Women and Color. Women and Color does not provide personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for use in marketing directly to you.</p>
          <p>(3) We may disclose information we collect, including personally identifiable information, to third parties as required or permitted by law. For example, we may disclose information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to regulators;</li>
            <li>to law enforcement authorities pursuant to an official request;</li>
            <li>to vendors who provide us with services; and</li>
            <li>to companies that may acquire part or all of Women and Color or an affiliated company.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you provide us with information pursuant to a transaction on or through the Service, you agree to the disclosure of any information you provide for the purpose of executing the transaction or fulfilling the request, as the case may be. Women and Color is not responsible for the protection of the information you provide to other websites. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information through other applications and websites, such information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications.</p>
          <h2>Advertising</h2>
          <p>We may use third-party companies to serve ads and provide content through the Website. These companies may use cookies and other data collection tools that are not sent by us to learn about your use of the Website and other websites and applications. Women and Color is not responsible for such cookies and tracking software.</p>
          <h2>Commercial Transactions</h2>
          <p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other reasons, we decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our business. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personally identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers or joint venture partners, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in the event such a transaction occurs.</p>
          <h2>Information Security</h2>
          <p>Whenever you enter an area of the site that carries, or requires you to enter, sensitive information such as your credit card details, a padlock icon will appear in the address bar of your browser, indicating that the page is secure. Women and Color uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Private Communications Technology security standards that are supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later and other popular browsers. SSL encodes your personal information by encrypting credit card number, name, address, phone number, identification number and your password so that they cannot be read by unauthorized parties. While we may at times provide encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not guarantee that information transmitted through the internet is secure, or that such transmissions will be free from delay, interruption, interception or error.</p>
          <p>Women and Color may implement certain physical, technological and managerial procedures to safeguard the personally identifiable information we collect. However, these procedures do not guarantee that the information will remain secure against theft or misuse.</p>
          <h2>Communications</h2>
          <p>From time to time, Women and Color and its affiliates may communicate with you regarding your transactions, the administration of your account, current projects, special offers, invitations to events, offers for services, new product previews and updates to the Service, press releases and announcements, contests and sweepstakes, as well as important changes to our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. By providing us with your e-mail address and/or your mobile phone number, you consent to receiving such communications. If at any time you decide for any reason that you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may “opt out” of receiving them through any of the following methods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Select the “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link, or follow the opt-out instructions that may be included in such communication.</li>
            <li>Where applicable, return to the web page or service where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions.</li>
            <li>E-mail us at hello@womenandcolor.com. Be sure to provide your name and e-mail address, and specific relevant information about the particular communication you no longer wish to receive.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving communications, it may affect your use of the Website. By registering as a user or entering into transactions through the website, you consent to receiving administration and transaction related communications.</p>
          <h2>Hyperlinks and Referrals</h2>
          <p>Other websites and applications accessible through the Service (through hyperlinks, advertisements or otherwise) have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult their Terms and Conditions and their Privacy Policies prior to use. We do not, even periodically, review the Privacy Policies or Terms of Use of third parties and we are not responsible or liable for their privacy practices, availability or reliability of the website they may provide, their services or the accuracy or completeness of their content. We seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome you to e-mail us about linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
          <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>We do not knowingly collect or distribute personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we know a visitor is under the age of 13, we will collect a parent’s permission before we collect, use, store or disclose any personal information supplied by that visitor. We will also allow parents/guardians to review any personal information we collect from children under 13 and to request that we stop using and delete such information at any time. If our policies change with regard to personal information that we previously received parental consent to collect, we will notify the parents of the changed policies. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe that we have collected personally identifiable information contrary to this policy or, in the United States, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), please contact us by e-mail so that we may delete such information. You can learn more about COPPA at the United States Federal Trade Commission website:</p>
